"""Early commit on a streamed structured LLM response.

The decision ("verdict") fields are placed first in the schema. This parser
reads the accumulated buffer and commits only when the verdict is provably
final, which requires three structural proofs:

  1. completion  - the value is terminated (closing quote / JSON terminator)
  2. membership  - the value belongs to the closed set declared in the schema
  3. order       - no later ("essay") field arrived before the verdict closed

A missing early verdict is recoverable: the caller falls back to the complete
response or to a deterministic default. A misparsed verdict is not.
